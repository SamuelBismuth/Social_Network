# Social_Network_CPP

A repository for the assignments of the course c++.

This repository includes the documentation (compressed) in the doxygen directory.
We add to the repository unit tests using Google test. You can run the files test.cpp which contains all our tests (in the googletest directory).
This repository also contains a txt file, with the id's of both contributors.

Also, if you want to run the project with the command "‫‪clang++-5.0‬‬ ‫‪-std=c++17‬‬ ‫‪*.cpp‬‬" you could do it from the main file that's why we duplicate the three files : main.cpp, member.cpp and Member.h.
